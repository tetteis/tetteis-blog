This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Instead of relying on third-party dependencies such as databases and content management systems, we store blog and portfolio items locally and fetch the data stored in markdown files. We parse the frontmatter to extract the formatted data and then provide the fetched content to the pages where it's displayed in the application.

We have implemented a search functionality that allows all content presented on the website to be searched via the input component provided in the navigation bar. The site content is used to build a local search index that is stored as a JSON file and fed as a data source to the search component.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying the pages in `pages/` directory. The components can also by modified in the `components/` directory. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
