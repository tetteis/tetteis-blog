This has been my all time favourite project because I've been able to maintain it since 2011, when I learnt to develop websites. Initially I used to share my religious beliefs on Facebook and a good Nigerian friend advised that I develop a blog to share my views instead of social media.  

I've seen this website go from the normal Facebook posts, to Google's Blogger, to WordPress and now to Next.JS! Yes, it's survived many generations ðŸ˜…. Through it I've developed a ton of experience migrating from project to project, solving all the challenges I encountered on the way.
