This is my all-time favorite personal portfolio project. The fact that I built it using modern architecture gives me great peace of mind. Although it wasn't easy working with TypeScript since I'm still getting familiar with this superset of the JavaScript language, I love it! üòç
  
In the future, I look forward to writing more blog posts as I explore further into the web development space, particularly as web3 becomes more prevalent. I'm very enthusiastic about learning more about blockchain technology. Watch this space for more articles.
