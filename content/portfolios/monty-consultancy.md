During my conversation with the Founder and CEO of Monty Safety Consultancy and General Supplies, we discussed the advantages of establishing an online presence, including the use of a customized, professional email. We talked about how having an online presence could provide a competitive advantage.

Rather than having people call all the time, the business could have potential customers submit their queries online and receive a prompt response. Additionally, a well-designed website would provide credibility and legitimacy in the eyes of potential clients. The website could also expand the company's reach beyond their local area and serve as a powerful marketing tool to promote their safety consultancy services.

Mr. Montford was in agreement with these points, and as a result, the company decided to create a website. I was responsible for choosing the appropriate tech stack, and ultimately decided on the Astro framework to minimize the use of JavaScript. I also chose to use Tailwind CSS, my favorite CSS framework, for styling the website.
