This is my all-time favorite personal portfolio project. The fact that I built it using modern architecture gives me great peace of mind. Although it wasn't easy working with TypeScript since I'm still getting familiar with this superset of the JavaScript language, I love it! üòç

Instead of relying on third-party dependencies such as databases and content management systems, we store blog and portfolio items locally and fetch the data stored in markdown files. We parse the frontmatter to extract the formatted data and then provide the fetched content to the pages where it's displayed in the application.

We have implemented a search functionality that allows all content presented on the website to be searched via the input component provided in the navigation bar. The site content is used to build a local search index that is stored as a JSON file and fed as a data source to the search component.
  
In the future, I look forward to writing more blog posts as I explore further into the web development space, particularly as web3 becomes more prevalent. I'm very enthusiastic about learning more about blockchain technology. Watch this space for more articles.
