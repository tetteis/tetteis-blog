This project has been my all-time favorite because I have been able to maintain it since 2011, when I first learned to develop websites. Initially, I used to share my religious beliefs on Facebook, but a good Nigerian friend advised me to develop a blog to share my views instead of relying solely on social media.

Over the years, I've seen this website evolve from Facebook posts to Google's Blogger, then to WordPress, and now to Next.JS. It has survived many generations ðŸ˜…, and through it, I have gained a ton of experience migrating from project to project and solving all the challenges I encountered along the way.
